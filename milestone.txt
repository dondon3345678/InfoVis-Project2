1. The dataset I check is Hillary Clinton's emails 
2. Currently I want to use https://github.com/nlp-compromise/compromise and Python's NLTK as my NLP techniques. I'd like to use TF-IDF to find out some keywords and which document they appear. 
3. My view will be ranking of keywords on the left, every keyword has many lines link to related documents. In the meantime, these documents will has links to receivers.
